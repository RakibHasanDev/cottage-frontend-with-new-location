          Not with standing any damages that You might incur, the entire
          liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision
          of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall
          be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or
          100 USD if You haven&apos;t purchased anything through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
          indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
          privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
          inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party
          hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any
          provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been
          advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
          fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
          limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
          means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
          states, each party&apos;s liability will be limited to the greatest
          extent permitted by law.

          kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of
          the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
          included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
          error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any

          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law.
